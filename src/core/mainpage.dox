\section sec_intro Introduction

This developer reference contains all classes from OVITO's core module and the standard plugin modules that are relevant
to plugin developers. Note, however, that the documentation is not complete yet, and the author is working on a 
high-level introduction into OVITO's C++ API.

For instructions how to build OVITO from source, see the [user manual](http://ovito.org/manual/development.html).
